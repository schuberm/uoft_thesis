\chapter{Introduction}

The problem of predicting material properties remains to a challenge to the present day. However, the arsenal of tools has become increasingly powerful with the steady advance of computational perfomance in accordance with Moore's Law. Indeed, computational techniques like Density Functional Theory (DFT), Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), and classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) have transitioned to the realm of the desktop PC (albeit for simple systems).

By directly evaluating the equations of motions for the system's particles (Newton's 2nd law for atoms in classical MD, Schrodinger's equation for electrons in DFT or QMC), macroscopic properties like electrical or thermal conductivity can be abstracted through the statistical behaviour of the particles' phase coordinates (e.i.: position and momentum).
