\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Four methods (GK, DM, ALD, NMD) for predicting thermal conductivity were reviewed and applied to a simple bulk system. An attempt was made to understand the effect on an interface upon individual phonon properties. Finally, GK, NMD and ALD were applied to a series of superlattices and the relevant physics were discussed.

Future work will be to incorporate the HLD functionality from GULP directly into the LAMMPS package. This a crucial step for NMD to applied to other systems besides LJ and SW silicon.

A topic that was only touched upon in this work is the understanding of size effects. Earlier studies relied upon macroscopic methods (i.e., GK and DM) to gain some insight into size effects. Due to the computational cost of a mode by mode analysis, NMD and ALD are conducted in such a way to use all available resources. As the algorithms, processing power and implementation improve, a rigorous study of the size effects upon each individual phonon mode will provide much needed insight.
